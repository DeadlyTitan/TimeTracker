# TimeTracker
A Unity3d extension to track the time you worked on a project

You can take a look at the TimeTrackerDocumentation.pdf for more detailed information.

This is a small unity extension that is tracking the time you spend on a project. I created this for my personal use and I hope you enjoy it.
